                <p>Just returned from Catanduanes. I was there with family the end of October.

The resort: I thought the place is well maintained. We booked the Regina suite (2 BR with one shared bath, kitchenette and living room). My main purpose was to check out the diving in Catanduanes. The rest of the family were there for some fun.</p>

<br><p>Dining: we mostly dined at the resort restaurant as it was rainy. I thought the food was good -breakfast, lunch and dinner. We mail ate ;the loccal food. My only pet peeve is the coffee. I prefer brewed coffee but, I noticed that, in the provinces, they mainly use those pre-packaged coffee mix (which, to me, hardly tasted like coffee at all).

Front desk and staffs: No complaints there. They are all very helpful and accommodating.</p>

<br><p>Internet: As in all the province I'd been to, connections can be sporadic specially when it is rainy. There is WIF at the registration area and in the rooms or grounds. Again, it can be sporadic. We found that signal is better on the balcony of our room. However, there are times when signal is good even in the bedrooms. It may all depend on how many users and the weather conditions there.</p>

<p class="alt-text">Early morning at Twin Rock beach </p>

<br><p>The diving: I did 4 dives with Dave of Catan Divers. They were reef dives; none or very mild current if at all.

We did not dive the reefs at Twin Rocks due to poor visibility at the time. 

We took the banca and went out to 4 different dive sites. All dives were done early in the morning timing the tide. Dave picked me up at the resort at 0600 and we are on the boat by 0700. The dive boat can carry 2 divers without problem, but will be too crowded with more divers. Dave said he uses two dive boats if there are 4 or more divers. Donning BCD is in water. 

One puts on the weight belt, slide into the water and Dave and his crew assisted with the BCD/tank.</p>

<br><p>Reef and marine life: There were some schooling fish, occasional spade fish, emperor angelfish, moorish idols, etc, Not in abundance but they were present in all the dives... I noticed coral spawning during the day dives (we did not do night dives). This was cool and something new to me. One particular dive site is so extensive and pristine, reminding me of Melissa's Garden at Raja Ampat.</p>

<p>Tucked in among the reef is a huge anemone housing hundreds of clownfish. Dave christened this dive site "Nemo City" appropriately. Ask Dave to take you there, if you ever dive in Catanduanes.</p>
    
<br><p>Overall, I would say the diving is good if you just want to do a weekend of diving. Dave continues to explore the area for more dive sites. He thinks there are mantas and is on a quest to find them. He'd seen dolphins, sharks, and seahorses on his dives.

The dive op: Dave is reliable, knowledgeable and well organized. One dives with air (he has an air compressor); No nitrox. He'll prepare breakfast and lunch and take them on the boat. Lunch consisted of pasta, or rice, with an entree and dessert. Dave prepared these himself. He also provided the drinking water as well as soda beverages. Just let him know your preferences.

Water temp: I was there end of October. Water was nice and warm. I wore a 3mm wetsuit and rash guard inside.

PM me if there are questions about diving at Catanduanes. Dave's contact info is info@catandivers.com

I hope to be able to go back and dive some more with Dave.
